"""
For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more,
so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is
less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded values.
To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper "def round10(num):"
and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as round_sum().
